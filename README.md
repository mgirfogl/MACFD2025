# Models and Applications in Computational Fluid Dynamics

- Michele Girfoglio (<michele.girfoglio@unipa.it>)

## Program

The course provides an introduction to the numerical simulation of incompressible flows by using a finite volume method. Each topic will be corroborated by a set of numerical examples to be performed within the open source C++ finite volume library OpenFOAM.

## Location

All lectures will be delivered at SISSA.

## Material

This repository contains, assignements, workspaces, and other material for the course.

New material will be uploaded frequently.
